                    <h2>Analysis of a Circular-loop Zigzag Thin-wire Antenna</h2>
                    <p>In this presentation, we develop an analytical model, using the electric field integral equation (EFIE) approach, for a folded zigzag thin-wire antenna, with the geometry of a circular-loop. Following a treatment described elsewhere [1], for the bi-elliptical toroidal helical antenna, the kernel of the integral expression for the magnetic vector potential for the problem is derived in a matrix format, through which distinct contributions to the radiation field by the circular-loop geometry and the zigzag emerge. The computational results obtained for some input characteristics and the far-zone fields, for an assumed uniform current distribution, indicate that choice of number of zigzag sections pro-vides the important possibilities of varying antenna's electrical length and controlling pattern directivity. Similar conclusions were arrived at by Zainud-Deen et al. [2], who investigated the performance features of zigzag antennas for portable radio equipment.</p>

                    <h2>A Matrix-vector-potential Analysis of the Bi-elliptical Toroidal Helical Antenna</h2>
                    <p>This paper develops exact expressions for the radiation field integrals of a single-wound bi-elliptical toroidal helical antenna, based on the vector magnetic potential approach. Using the conventional thin-wire approximation in which current flow is constrained along the wire's axis, a vector-potential integral is developed for the problem in terms of the unknown current distribution and physical attributes of the wire antenna, with the integrals' integrands expressed in matrix format. Entries into these integrand matrices lend themselves into certain physical interpretations, which facilitate a number of conclusions concerning the physics of the problem. For example, it becomes readily discernible that the antenna's radiation field admits description as a sum of two expressions; one deriving from the main loop, and the other associ-ated with the poloidal loops of the antenna. These same conclusions were arrived at from the results of the empirical investigations reported in the open literature by Wanamassa et al. [1], and Corum [2]. Analytical results obtained in the paper also clearly indicate that the radiation fields may also be attributed to contributions associated with electric and magnetic currents excited in the antenna's main loop and poloidal loops, respectively. It is shown in the paper that the field expressions developed by the analytical approach reported, also serve as corresponding expressions for certain other configurations of the toroidal antenna as special cases.</p>

                    <h2>A moment-method analysis of a thin-wire Chireix-coil antenna</h2>
                    <p>Using a moment-method solution technique in an Electric-Field Integral Equation (EFIE) formulation approach, this presentation examines certain performance characteristics of the electrically thin-wire variety of the Chireix-coil antenna, whose geometry as defined by [2] is given by Cλ = √1+2Sλ, where the parameters (Cλ, Sλ), respectively symbolize helix circumference and turn spacing, measured in units of wavelength at the operating frequency. Computational results obtained for the Chireix coil with 4-, 6-, 8-, and 10-turns suggest that the maximum value of magnitude of current distributed along the axis of the antenna is more or less independent of number of antenna turns. And the results also indicate that when Sλ is less than 0.9, the radiation field (Eθ, Eφ) patterns on the azimuthal plane consist of two diametrically directed majors; which degenerate into four distinct lobes (with relative maxima along φ = 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270° axes) for values of Sλ in excess of 1.0. A particularly remarkable feature of these radiation field pattern characteristics is that they appear to be independent of the number of coil turns.</p>

                    <h2>Performance characteristics of loop antennas above a ground plane of finite extent</h2>
                    <p>This paper examines the characteristic behaviors of the feed-point input impedance and radiation fields of two thin-wire loop antenna types (one a circular-loop and the other, a square-loop antenna) both, one wavelength (1λ) long at the operating frequency, and located over a ground plane which is of the wire-grid variety [1], and whose extent is finite. Using the moment-method approach, computational results are obtained in the presentation, for the antennas' performance parameters alluded to in the foregoing, to suggest that the square loop antenna resonates when located at a distance of 0.054λ above the ground plane; whereas the corresponding distance for the circular-loop emerges as 0:132λ. The results also indicate that the antennas' directive gains and input impedance profiles are such as to suggest that they may be suitable for practical applications over a wide range of frequencies. A comparison carried out in the paper, between computed values of input impedance and corresponding measurement results reported elsewhere [2], very clearly indicate that the approach described in this presentation is valid.</p>

                    <h2>On the Radiation Fields of the Hyperbolic Helical Antenna</h2>
                    <p>Cylindrical helical antenna structures of various cross-sections have received exten-sive analytical attention in the open literature, starting with the 1947 contributions of Kraus [2], through those of Wong and Loh [4], to Adekola et al. [3, 6], to mention a few. One geometry that has yet, to the best of our knowledge, to be treated is that of the helix, wound on a hyperbolic cylinder, which is the focus of this presentation. Utilizing the circuit-geometric approach offered by the method of moments, the paper models the hyperbolic helical antenna as a configuration of two thin-wire elements, one or both of which may be excited. Analysis followed that described elsewhere [3], and the computational results obtained for the configuration in which only one of the two elements has a delta-gap excitation suggest that the hyperbolic helical antenna of this type should be particularly suitable for applications requiring multi-lobed radiation patterns.</p>

                    <h2>Performance Characteristics of a Dual-sense Helical-beam Antenna</h2>
                    <p>Several years ago, Coleman and Wright [1], experimentally demonstrated the fea-sibility of exciting a dual-sense circularly polarized field, using a single-element helical antenna. The results obtained and described by [1] suggest that good on-axis axial ratios then become available, and that the off-axis axial ratios may be rated 'reasonable'. It was discovered [1], in particular, that the off-axis axial ratio for the added port of the antenna's feed arrangement was significantly worse on account of an imbalance in the feed as well as currents excited along the axially located outer coaxial conductor. This paper, using a moment-method analytical approach earlier developed for elliptical cylindrical thin-wire helical antenna [2], investigates the possibility of improving off-axis ratios for the dual-sense helical antenna through an informed location of the added port and choice of amplitude and relative phase of feed point excitation voltage. Computational results obtained suggest that both choice of location and magnitude and relative phase of feed point excitation voltage can lead to significant improvements in both on-axis and off-axis axial ratios for the dual-sense helical antenna. In addition to offering possibilities for compensating for the imbalance in the feed and effects of currents excited in the outer coaxial conductor alluded to in [1], the proposals described in this paper indicate such other antenna parameters as polarization sense of radiated field, of interest to optimum energy transfer can be controlled through the use of the dual-feed arrangement of the type proposed in [1].</p>

                    <h2>Input Characteristics of Coated Thin Wire Helix Antenna</h2>
                    <p>In this paper, we investigate the effects of the dielectric insulation on the input impedance and admittance characteristics of coated thin-wire helical antennas, using the quasi-static moment-method approach described elsewhere by Adekola et al. [1]. For the dielectric insulation modeled by a Schelkunuff's volume polarization current, the unknown quantity is the electric field in the dielectric region due to the distribution of current along the axis of the un-insulated wire, which is also an unknown quantity. The quasi-static approach assumes that both unknowns are related in the manner specified by Richmond and Newman [2], and Lee and Balmain [3], so that the problem then becomes completely solved, when using the method of moments, the unknown current distribution is obtained. One interesting feature of the paper is the demonstration that the circuit-geometric character of the moment-methods enables the formulation for the coated elliptical cylindrical helical antenna to serve as a general case for certain regular thin-wire geometries. Numerical results obtained for the representative examples of a coated monofilar helix (backed by a large ground plane) describe effects of coating these antenna types as consistent with those reported by Desplanches et al. [4].</p>

                    <h2>Compact theory of the broadband elliptical helical antenna</h2>
                    <p>The compact theory described in this presentation develops a robust elliptical integro-differential operator, through which, in a novel manner, an expression is derived for the field radiated by a thin-wire elliptical-cylindrical helical antenna, as a general case for thin-wire antennas of regular geometrical shapes. Using the circuit-geometric approach offered by the Method of Moments, analysis in the paper first derives an expression for the radiation field of a thin-wire antenna, whose geometrical shape is an elliptical-cylindrical helix; and then demonstrates that the expression reduces to those for other thin-wire antennas of regular geometrical shapes, when conditions that change the ellipticalcylindrical helical geometry to those other geometries are imposed. Having in this manner, validated the correctness of the formulation, a numerical evaluation is undertaken for the helical antenna mounted on a ground plane of infinite extent, which ground plane serves the purposes of a counterpoise, among a few others, in practical applications. In addition, other computational results are presented in the form of response curves for the 'exclusionmode' and balanced helixes, and the results are in excellent agreement with experimental data available in the open literature. A number of practical applications are highlighted in the paper, including applications in satellite-, wireless-, and deep-space communications.</p>

                    <h2>A rigorous analysis of the radiation characteristics of helical-beam antennas</h2>
                    <p>A rigorous analysis of the radiation characteristics of helical-beam antennas commonly employed for terrestrial and satellite communications is presented in this paper. Use is made, in that connection, of a formulation for the elliptical helical antenna, whose geometry represents a general case for several wire antennas of regular geometrical shapes. After the deriving the governing integro-differential equation by connecting an incident electric field and the distribution of current excited by its incidence, a solution to the problem so defined is obtained through the use of the method of moments with a Galerkin procedure. As a demonstration of the utility of the formulation, the paper then addresses the problem of a circular helical antenna excited without the conventional ground plane. The computational results obtained are consistent with those available in the open literature, and clearly reveal that the antenna structure may find useful application as feed for a dish antenna of the type utilized for radio communications at the satellite frequencies.</p>
